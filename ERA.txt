Dear RJIO Family,

                    My 7.4 year professional affiliation with Reliance JIO will come to an end today, and it's time to say goodbye to everyone. I have had the incredible pleasure of working with the Reliance family, which has provided me with a wealth of experience, challenges, learning opportunities, and opportunities for personal development.

My lengthy journey with Reliance would not have been as successful without the leadership and direction of all of my lead’s and HOD’s, for which I am incredibly grateful.

With all of you around, every day used to be fresh and full of new spirits. We were all an inspiration to one another, and together we accomplished a lot of new things.

                                     
                                                                         
                                                                      ::::::::::::::::::Thank you JIO::::::::::::::::::
